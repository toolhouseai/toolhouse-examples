## Intro
Toolhouse is a platform that helps developers integrate tools in their projects, to build powerful AI agents. 
In this repo we'll explore some examples of different ways you can leverage our pre-built tools and create agents that can perform many useful tasks.

## Examples
- Customer Support Agent
- Job Search Agent
- Code assistant

## ℹ️ Getting started 

To follow along these examples we've separated them in sub-folders within this repository. For ease of use, you only have to install the dependencies once.
Each folder uses a different set of Tools hosted and maintained by Toolhouse.

## 🛠️ Installation 
To install (from within the folder where this file lives):


#### With virtual environment (Preferred)

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Without virtual env
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


Finally move to the folder which contains the agent of your choice:
```bash
cd agents/customer-support
```

Start the agent:
```bash
python agent.py
```

## Why build AI Agents
There is a growing interest in creating AI agents - powered by LLMs and tools. The main goal of an AI agent is to complete a task a user gives it. This task might require the agent to perform multiple steps autonomously or with little user intervention. To complete these steps, the LLM powering the agent will require to use function calls (a.k.a tool usage) to interact with other  software, for example by calling REST APIs.
Different agents will require different tools to perform their tasks successfully.

## How Toolhouse helps
Today's LLM technology doesn't run any code itself. Instead, you can run code externally: Toolhouse runs the code through the tool chosen by the LLM and on behalf the LLM. Once the tool has run it then tells the LLM what the output was.

Writing good tools is a long and time-consuming exercise which requires a lot of efforts. You have to write definitions of inputs and outputs, robust error handling, handle the infrastructure to host the tool and most importantly effective communication with the model. Every model implements function calling slightly differently. This causes challenges in schema design, logic implementation, and interaction management.

✨ Using Toolhouse - you can use tools that have been written and maintained for you and know that you're going to get the best quality.
